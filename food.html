        <div class="caption">Pair fresh seafood with California cuisine—and a spectacular view of the iconic Bay Bridge—for a perfect night out on the Bay. The Waterfront has seafood galore, where you can dive into a selection of fresh oysters, oven roasted Dungeness crab and New York strip steak. </div>

                  <div class = "caption">For Peking duck and dim sum lovers, Crystal Jade is a destination not to miss. From their simple dishes, like seafood fried rice and crispy noodles, to their extravagant specialties, like their apple wood-roasted suckling pig, you can savor authentic Asian cuisine while taking in amazing views of the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero.</div>

Since you won’t find a set menu at this Michelin star restaurant, it is a perfect destination for guests who enjoy a culinary surprise.</div>

              <li style = "font-family: San Francisco Display Medium">Acquerello: 1722 Sacramento St., San Francisco, CA 94109</li>
              <p style = "font-family: San Francisco Display Thin">One of the first SF restaurants to serve authentically regional Italian food, Acquerello has only continued to grow since 1989, moving into an increasingly fine-dining direction while maintaining its commitment to Italian wine and local products. It now holds two Michelin stars, a distinction that chef Suzette Gresham (who's been there since the beginning) shares with only two other women in the entire U.S.</p>
              <li style = "font-family: San Francisco Display Medium">Big 4: 1075 California St., San Francisco, CA 94108</li>
              <p style = "font-family: San Francisco Display Thin">A recent renovation didn't change the soul of this clubby restaurant in the Huntington Hotel, named for the Bay Area's railroad pioneers. It's full of cocktails, grizzled bartenders, California memorabilia, and a hefty dose of live piano music.</p>
              <li style = "font-family: San Francisco Display Medium">Cliff House: 1090 Point Lobos Ave., San Francisco, CA 94121</li>
              <p style = "font-family: San Francisco Display Thin">With its staggering views of the coastline and the ruins of the Sutro Baths, this SF icon has undergone a long series of fires, rebuildings, shutters, and reopenings to achieve its current crown-jewel status. It's a little oasis at the end of the world.</p>
