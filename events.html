    <p style = "font-style: San Francisco Display Thin">Since launching its first farmers market in 1943, San Francisco's farmers market game has expanded to include a weekly event in almost every neighborhood. No longer just stands for organic fruit and vegetable sales, today’s farmers markets come complete with gourmet artisan goods, grass-fed and sustainably raised meats, live entertainment and educational events. For the most variety, including hard-to-find Asian greens and wild mushrooms, try the city’s three largest markets at the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero, on Alemany Boulevard in Bernal Heights and in Civic Center’s United Nations Plaza.</p>

    <p>One such farmer's market is the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market, where three times a week, shoppers will find more than 100 fruit and veggie growers and artisan food makers at stalls in front and along the south side of the Ferry Building. On Saturdays, heavily trafficked food stands like Primavera’s gourmet Mexican food and free public education programs feed the bellies and minds of the market’s 30,000 visitors.</p>

    <p>Spring in San Francisco means festival season has officially arrived. From April through October, a variety of free events are held in neighborhoods throughout the city. One such fair is the Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival, where for two weekends, Japantown welcomes spring by featuring food booths, cultural performances, martial arts, live bands, the annual Cherry Blossom Queen program, and a Grand Parade. Another festival is the Earth Day Festival, where thousands of people from the Bay Area will converge at Civic Center Plaza in the heart of San Francisco to celebrate Earth Day 2018 with guest speakers, DIY workshops, and more.</p>
